                    The following is a quote from George Santayana: <em>"I have imagination, and nothing that is real is alien to me."</em>
                    <span id="hidden1" class="hidden">
                        To make that work, I spend a not insignificant portion of my time imagining things. I also spend an even greater part of my time trying to make those dreams a reality. So what are these thoughts that occupy so much of my time? Mostly just problems and inconveniences in my life and just sometimes, those of other people.

                        The ancient Greeks believed that a good citizen was a well-rounded individual.
                        While I don't live in ancient Greece, I still think it is a good idea,
                        especially with the recent emphasis on the benefits of cross-disciplinary practices.
                        I find a simple (perhaps oversimplified) way of thinking about it
                        is a spectrum ranging from the liberal arts to the sciences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still haven't said what I do,
                        maybe you think this is a waste of time,
                        maybe you should have clicked <a href="/about/">that link</a> that promised less words.
                        So here it is: I make shiny, glowing rocks do what people want it to do.
                        Put more plainly, I work with <em>computers</em>,
                        mostly as a <strong>software <a href="https://github.com/arccy">developer</a></strong> with a preference for using Go,
                        but I'll use whatever is appropriate for the job (shell scripts, python, C/C++, SQL, javascript, etc..).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere further towards the arts is the <strong>designer</strong> in me. Not just someone who makes things pretty, thats the <em>artist</em>, the designer is someone who asks the right questions before creating the solution. This lends itself to UI/UX, some people might even call this Design Thinking &trade;, but that's just a marketing term for something that good designers should already be doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remainder of my time is spent somewhat relaxing the left half of my brain (as if I can turn off my right hand), and channelling my inner Picasso. Okay, maybe not on that level, and maybe not even in painting. I draw, design websites, as a <strong>photographer</strong> I take photos both as a hobby and a job and I've worked as both <strong>lighting and sound technicians</strong> in mid-sized venues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So with all that said, I hope you don't feel that it has been a complete waste of your time and I hope you enjoy the rest of the <a href="/graphs/">site</a>.
